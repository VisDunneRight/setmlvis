# Introduction

**SetMLVis** is an innovative interactive visualization system designed for use within Jupyter notebooks. It facilitates the comparison of different object detection models, addressing the limitations of aggregate metrics and the visual clutter inherent in multiple image detections. This system adopts a unique approach by comparing models at the detection level. Utilizing a set visualization inspired by Upset ([Upset](https://upset.app/)), SetMLVis intelligently matches detections across various models, effectively pre-processing data into insightful slices. This method shows the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each model.
